# PEP8 Linter

> This is a linter for python code.

Python has PEP-8 as the Style Standard for coding you can read more about it [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

> A code that follows a style is easier to read.

I decided to build this linter because Python is one of most popular languages, personally I use it to make automatization with [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) and web applications with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com)

The coolest feature about this linter are the colors, I used some of the code posted here [Colorize Console](https://gist.github.com/KenanAcar/6387f4c331179ec4a49c44d3fea46a14)

The most valuable tool to build this linter was use regular expressions or Regex I used the info posted here in [Rubular](https://rubular.com)
